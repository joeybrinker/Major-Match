# Major Match
Major Match is a project I completed under 24 hours during Hack Dearborn at University of Michigan - Dearborn.

## Features
Major Match provides financial literacy for those looking to go to college. Simply type in your desired major, select your state, and type of degree. Major Match will provide the top 5 best programs in your selected state as well as the top 5 cheapest programs in the state for your major.

## What I learned
During this project, I learned how to communicate with OpenAI's API in Swift by using an HTTP Request. I also learned a handful about TextFields and Menus in SwiftUI.

## How to use 
- Download the Git repository as a zip file and open it in Xcode. 
- Then navigate to https://openai.com/api/ and log in to "API Platform". 
- Click on "Dashboard" which should be in the top right, and select "API Keys" on the left side. 
- Once you select "API Keys", click "Create new secret key" and name it what you would like. 
- Click "Create secret key" after naming and then copy the key it gives you. DO NOT SHARE THIS KEY WITH ANYONE AND DO NOT CLICK AWAY UNITL YOU HAVE COPIED THE KEY. 
- Once copied, go back to the Xcode project and find the variable "api_key". 
- In the empty quotes (""), paste your api key given to you in the previous step. 
- Now, you can build the project and try it for yourself!
